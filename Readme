# 🅿️ ParkSecure – Community Parking Marketplace (WIP)

ParkSecure is a **community-driven parking platform** where individuals can list their unused parking spaces (home driveways, private plots, society parking) and drivers can discover and book them for short or long durations.

> 🚧 **Status:** Work in Progress (Active Development)

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Urban areas face severe parking shortages, leading to:
- Traffic congestion
- Illegal parking & fines
- Time and fuel wastage

At the same time, many private parking spaces remain unused for long hours.  
**ParkSecure bridges this gap** by connecting space owners with drivers in need.
